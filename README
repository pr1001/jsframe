jsFrame is a web application framework written entirely in Javascript and HTML by Peter Robinett over the course of a lazy Sunday. The framework was simply intended as a programming exercise and is only at version 0.0.1, so it's surely not production-ready! That being said, I'm putting it out there in the hope that other people can benefit from it and if it strikes there fancy can grow beyond its modest origins.

See http://labs.bubblefoundry.com/jsframe/ or http://github.com/pr1001/jsframe/tree/master for more information.
